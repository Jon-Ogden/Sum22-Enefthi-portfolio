# Welcome to our ENEFTHI Project!
We have been working hard to develop this NFT/Digital art trading app and while it is not done yet,
the code we have so far is a testament to our skills as full-stack developers! 

## Some details about our Project:
 - ENEFTHI is pronounced EN-ef-tee
 - While we have received help from teachers and TA's in our cohort, every line of code here was written by the three of us.
 - We are still working on it and adding features every day, so if something looks incomplete, check back again soon!
